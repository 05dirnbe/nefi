Quick Start Guide for users
===========================

So, you want to know what is NEFI2 good for now? Currently it is good for extracting networks from images.
Imagine you have a big collection of spider webs pictures and you want to do an interesting research on how different are the web structures of Cross and Banded Garden spider.
You spend some time on collecting a *statistically significant* amount of images and... attempt to understand the differences by looking through the collection.
Well, really?
No, you better delegate this task to NEFI2.
NEFI2 is capable of batch processing a large collection of images and extracting a `NetworkX graph objects <https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/introduction.html>`_ that you can use later to process and get numerical data or even train a spider web recognizer.

But first, let's take a look at NEFI2 interface.
