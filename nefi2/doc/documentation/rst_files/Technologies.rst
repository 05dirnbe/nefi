PyQt
----
In order to install the PyQt Framework on your computer, you need to install the Qt framework (cpp framework) in version 4.5 and 5.5 before.
Download : http://www.qt.io/
For this project you can download the open source version of the Qt framework!

You also require sip for the further installation process.

To compile the Qt framework for Python we use PyQt 5.5

It is highly recommended to use the binary installation for PyQt on Windows. Make sure you build your PyQt
framework for your python 3.4 interpreter. Also note that you cannot have a PyQt 4.5 and PyQt 5.5 version. For this
project you need only PyQt 5.5 so make sure to remove the PyQt 4.5 if you installed it before.
On debian systems it is recommended to use aptitude to install PyQt

Recommended IDE

The former software development team used PyCharm but you are free to use any IDE you desire.
