NEFI is a Python tool created to extract networks from images.
Given a suitable 2D image of a network as input, NEFI outputs a mathematical
representation of the structure of the depicted network as a weighted
undirected planar graph. Representing the structure of the network as a graph
enables subsequent studies of its properties using tools and concepts from
graph theory.
