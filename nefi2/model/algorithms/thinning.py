"""
Thinning is the operation that takes a binary image and contracts the
foreground until only single-pixel wide lines remain. It is also known as
skeletonization.

The algorithm below was taken from NEFI1. It uses thinning C module written by
`Adrian Neumann <https://bitbucket.org/adrian_n/thinning>`_.
The code was adapted for NEFI2.
