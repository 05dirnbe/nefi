Thinning is the operation that takes a binary image and contracts the
foreground until only single-pixel wide lines remain. It is also known as
skeletonization.

The algorithm below was taken from NEFI1. It uses thinning C module written by
`Adrian Neumann <https://bitbucket.org/adrian_n/thinning>`_.
The code was adapted for NEFI2.

    the skeleton are categorized as nodes/non-nodes based on the value of a
    function A(p) depending on the pixel neighborhood of p. Please check the
    above paper for details.

    A(p1) == 1: The pixel p1 sits at the end of a skeleton line, thus a node
    of degree 1 has been found.
    A(p1) == 2: The pixel p1 sits in the middel of a skeleton line but not at
    a branching point, thus a node of degree 2 has been found. Such nodes are
    ignored and not introduced to the graph.
    A(p1) >= 3: The pixel p1 belongs to a branching point of a skeleton line,
    thus a node of degree >=3 has been found.
