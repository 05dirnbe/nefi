"""
A module which contains all necessary information's and features to create
an additional implementation of algorithms.
To contribute an algorithm implementation the contributor is needs to create
a seperate <algorithm_name>.py in the algorithms folder. In <algorithm_name>.py
he needs to create a class "class AlgBody(Algorithm):" which inherits from Algorithm.
In order to give the ext_loader the possibility to dynamically invoke the algorithm
definition, the contributor also needs to override the methods: process(self, image),
get_name(self) and belongs_to(self).
Additional UI input for the algorithm can be specified by creating IntegerSlider, FloatSlider,
CheckBox or DropDown objects. These object instances need to be created by the constructor method
__init__(self) of the algorithm implementation. E.g. we create a IntegerSlider in __init__(self)
by calling the constructor of IntegerSlider and binding it to slider1 with
"slider1 = IntegerSlider(self, "slider1", 0, 10, 1, 0)" (see the IntegerSlider definition
for further information)
