    \brief Tab represents the content of a tab in a TabView.

    A Tab item inherits from Loader and provides a similar
    API.

    Tabs are lazily loaded; only tabs that have been made current (for example,
    by clicking on them) will have valid content. You can force loading of tabs
    by setting the active property to \c true:

    \code
    Tab {
        active: true
    }
    \endcode

    \sa TabView
*/

Loader {
    id: tab
    anchors.fill: parent

    /*! This property holds the title of the tab. */
    property string title

    /*! \internal */
    property bool __inserted: false

    Accessible.role: Accessible.LayeredPane
    active: false
    visible: false

    activeFocusOnTab: false

    onVisibleChanged: if (visible) active = true

    /*! \internal */
    default property alias component: tab.sourceComponent
}
