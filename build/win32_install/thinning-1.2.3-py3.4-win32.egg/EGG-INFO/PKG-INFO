Description: Thinning
        ========
        
        Thinning is the operation that takes a binary image and contracts the foreground until only single-pixel wide lines remain. It is also known as skeletonization.
        
        This package implements the thinning algorithm by Guo and Hall[1] for Numpy arrays. It is thus compatible with OpenCV. The algorithm is implemented in C and fairly fast.
