HOW TO SUBMIT A CUSTOM METHOD?
Cakewalk!

If you want to add a new image processing method follow the instructions below.
Keep in mind that a new method is just a processing step placeholder and
does not contain any logic except the name. You will have to add new algorithms
for it to make it work.

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Copy EXAMPLE below (everything between triple quotes) into a newly created
file and place it into current ("/modules/methods") directory.
2. Change __meth_name__ variable name. Your method's name must be unique.
3. Add your method's name into "/nefi2/config.xml" file. This config file
controls the order of the method execution.

If everything is ok the method should appear in the UI drop-down menu.

EXAMPLE

'''
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import _meth


__meth_name__ = 'MY NEW METHOD'


def get_name():
    """
    Return method name that will be displayed in UI.
    Args:
        __algorithm__ -- algorithm's name to be displayed in UI
    """
    return __meth_name__


def new(methmap):
    """
    Create a new Method instance.
    Args:
        methmap -- a simple dict mapping: algorithm --> method
    """
    return _meth.Method(get_name(), methmap)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    pass
