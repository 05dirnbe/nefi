    \brief An abstract representation of a checkable control with a label
    \qmlabstract
    \internal

    A checkable control is one that has two states: checked (on) and
    unchecked (off). AbstractCheckable encapsulates the basic behavior and
    states that are required by checkable controls.

    Examples of checkable controls are RadioButton and
    CheckBox. CheckBox extends AbstractCheckable's behavior by adding a third
    state: partially checked.
